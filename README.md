# How do I approach designing software?

This is a difficult question as it really depends on how familiar I am creating the desired program. For this project, I was completely unfamiliar with OpenGL.
As such, I didn't spend much time designing software before I went writing code.

# How do I approach developing programs?

My approach is to first create basic functionality and, after testing that it works, encapsulate it into its own code segment.
Then, I add another piece of functionality and this process repeats until I have a program that has all of the functionality that I
want it to have. What I've learned from this project is that I should continue to do exactly this. Whenever I had issues working on this project,
the answer always seemed to be to do more encapsulation.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Well, computer science is a field of problem solving. If I ever have a problem that nobody has an answer for, I can use my knowledge in computer science to
solve the problem myself. It's hard to say how useful OpenGL will be to me in the future, but I'm confident that I can come back to it should I need to.
